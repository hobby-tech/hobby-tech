Hello I am Manik, learning, gardening, animal husbandry, coding, drawing, singing, wood working, electric and electronic  and many things is my passion.

I believe that "learn from the cradle to the grave"

I like to face problems the most because there is a lot of new knowledge, solutions and asking for more new things hidden behind a problem!


I know little bit about (Arduino or C ++), CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Photoshop, Illustrator, Video Editing, Animation Creating, 3d modeling, 3d printing and many creative ideas and for that I want to share my little experience. With my audience!

I am grateful for your support of my content. I will do my best to make an informative and educational video.

Thanks!
